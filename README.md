# scifi-landscape

A procedural sci-fi landscape generator. Scenes are drawn one element at a
time — the construction is animated on screen so you can watch it build — and
every scene is fully determined by a single random **seed**, so any scene can
be reproduced exactly just by knowing its seed. The finished image stays on
screen and can be saved to a PNG.

This is a modern reimagining of an old 256-color graphics experiment.

## Running

```sh
go run .                 # random seed, 1280x720 window
go run . -seed 12345     # reproduce a specific scene
go run . -seed mars      # any text works too (hashed to a seed)
go run . -time dusk      # force the time of day (midday | dusk | twilight)
go run . -w 1920 -h 1080 # custom size
```

A seed can be **a number or any text**. A plain integer (within int64 range) is
used directly; anything else — a word, a phrase, a too-big number — is hashed to
a stable seed, so `-seed mars` always yields the same scene. The resolved seed
is printed to the terminal on startup and shown on the on-screen HUD.

### Controls

| Key       | Action                                    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `N` / `Space` | Generate a new random scene           |
| `R`       | Replay the current seed (re-animate)      |
| `E`       | Enter a seed (type a number or text, `Enter` to apply, `Esc` to cancel) |
| `S`       | Save the current image to `scifi-<seed>.png` |
| `Q` / `Esc` | Quit                                    |

### Headless rendering

To render straight to a PNG without opening a window (useful for batches):

```sh
go run ./cmd/render -seed 12345 -o scene.png
go run ./cmd/render -seed mars -time twilight -w 1920 -h 1080
```

The interactive app and the headless renderer share the exact same element
pipeline, so a given seed produces an identical image either way.

## How it works

A scene is a sequence of **elements** drawn back-to-front onto a shared canvas.
Global **settings** are chosen first and shape how every element is drawn. All
randomness comes from one seeded `math/rand` source consumed in a fixed order,
which is what makes scenes reproducible.

### Global settings (so far)

- **Time of day** — `midday`, `dusk`, or `twilight`. Drives the sky palette.
- **Horizon point** — between 20% and 50% of the scene height *measured from
  the bottom* (the ground's share), normally distributed around ~35%. So the
  sky always fills 50–80% of the scene — there's never more ground than sky.
  The sky gradient is anchored at this line.
- **Twinkle angle** — the shared orientation of star twinkle spikes, 0–90°,
  biased hard toward 0° (90° is rarest). Every twinkling star uses this angle.
- **Star density** — a log-normal multiplier on the earthlike star count,
  biased so a richer-than-earthlike sky (~1.7×) is typical, still ranging from a
  near-empty sky to a dense cluster.

### Elements (so far)

- **Sky** — a vertical gradient filling the scene, anchored at the horizon
  (brightest) and darkening toward the top:
  - *Midday*: any hue, light/desaturated at the horizon → dark/saturated up top
    (e.g. gray-blue→deep-blue for an Earth-like sky, pink→deep-red for Mars).
  - *Dusk*: a wild multi-stop journey that starts warm and bright, runs through
    a range of hues (yellow→orange→red, yellow→green→blue, ...), and trends to
    near-black at the top.
  - *Twilight*: mostly black, with a dim glow near the horizon fading out,
    sometimes picking up a faint second color higher up.

  Below the horizon the sky is mirrored and dimmed, ready to be reused as a
  water reflection by a later element (otherwise it is overwritten).

- **Stars** — points of light scattered over the sky (none at midday). Each has
  its own color (mostly near-white, split between blue-white and warm tints) and
  brightness. Most are single pixels; a few are tiny discs; a rare few are discs
  with twinkle spikes drawn at the global twinkle angle. At twilight stars cover
  the whole scene; at dusk they fade toward the bottom via alpha. How many stars
  appear is set by the star-density setting.

- **System stars** — the local sun(s) of the system (only in daylight and at
  dusk, never twilight). There are 0–5, usually 0 or 1, with higher counts much
  rarer at dusk. Each has its own color and a size biased small (about like
  Earth's sun) with a rare tail up to 20% of the sky width. A soft circular glow
  brightens the sky around each before its disc is drawn (white-hot core fading
  to the sun's color); small ones get a twinkle cross at the global angle. At
  dusk the suns sit on or near the horizon, like a setting sun.

## Code layout

```
main.go              interactive entry point (flags, window)
cmd/render/          headless PNG renderer
internal/seed/       resolve a number-or-text seed to an int64
internal/gfx/        RGB/HSV color + gradient interpolation
internal/canvas/     concurrency-safe RGBA drawing surface
internal/scene/      settings, the Element interface, the Sky/Stars/SystemStars elements
internal/app/        Ebiten front-end + generation controller
```

New scene elements implement `scene.Element` and are added to the pipeline in
`scene.New`.
